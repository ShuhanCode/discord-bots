# 38. Course & Code Update 2023

**Course Update 2023**

The course has been updated and the code within this Discord bot is new 2023.
The following lectures are from 2022 and does not affect the new Discord.js update.

1.  Creating a Discord Server
1.  Discord Bot Creation
1.  app.js + inviting the Bot
1.  Discord.js
1.  npm installation

*The DRY - Don't repeat yourself part will be found later in the course.*

There will be a new course update lecture that explains some differences but those are minimal and doesn't need to re-create the lectures above. After that, the lectures will be new for 2023 with correct intents and partials.

**If anything is unclear or isn't in sync/missing, let me know and I will fix that.**
