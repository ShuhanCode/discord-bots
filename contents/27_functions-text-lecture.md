**Functions**

Functions within programming contains set of instructions to be evaluated. What does this mean? Let's look at the example below.

```
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

The function above contains 1 line of code and that is a console.log statement that prints "Hello World!" to the console. But you need to call the function in order to execute the code inside. Because right now, that function is never used. Let's call it.

```
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}
hello();
```

Now we've called the function and "Hello World!" is printed to the console. But why is the function important?
Remember that I explained earlier that a variable is like a box that contains something. A function is like a room that contains a lot of boxes and other stuff. A function can contain a lot of variables, if statements, for loops, JSON objects etc. Function is the core concept of programming. Basically with functions we store the code inside that we want to run at specific times.
