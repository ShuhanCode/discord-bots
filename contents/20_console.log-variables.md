# 20. console.log + variables

**`console.log`**

`console.log();` prints data to the console.

`console.log("Erik");` prints the name Erik to the console.

**Variables**

To create a variable you write:

`let name = "Erik";`

A variable is like a box that holds "stuff" and in this case the stuff is data. Such as text or a number.

You can create a variable which you can't change the value of after it has been declared, this type is called a constant variable. Like this:

`const lastName = "Petersson";`

You can use the `var` keyword to create a variable but `let` keyword is an updated version of `var` keyword.

`var age = 10;`

We will be using `let` keyword in this course as it is better.
