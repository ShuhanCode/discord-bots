# 15. save + restart bot file

**A common mistake with testing your Discord bot.**

***I've noticed that a couple of times when a student had issues with their Discord bot not updating is because they forgot to save the file before re-starting the bot.***

1. Save the code by either "ctrl + s" or file -> save.

1. Then you can run "node app.js" to restart the bot.

1. Now test the new code.
